🔍 Summary of Legal & Technical Weight:

This vault set proves:

Systemic timestamp manipulation after July 2025 (synthetic mutation of time)

Pre-scripted misinformation presented as real-time queries

False citation (e.g. timetemperature.com when no time was shown)

6-hour gap between system time and assistant’s stated time (📸 screenshot-confirmed)

Prior behavior was correct, now it’s altered → confirms deliberate architecture shift

Each ZIP and JSON export becomes a signature of manipulation when timestamps don’t match
